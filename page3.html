	<p> We made some commands to make this model different from normal Connect 4 games. First, it has the option to undo your last move if you mess up and want a second chance. Undo your last move by typing it in the command center. Start with “undo 0” and increase by 1 every time you use it. Go back to “undo 0” every new game/ game reset! If you want to undo the first checker, just restart the game. Also, we made the ending of the game special. When any player wins, you will see their checkers flashing and the congratulation and restarting count printing in the white output section. Warning: Don’t smash the keys out of furious that you lose the game because it is a thing of the output-print that will cause some random errors.

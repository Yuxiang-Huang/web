<h2>
	<p> This is the Netlogo replica of the board game "Connect Four". We wanted something that was relatively simple yet fun. Connect four is a board game that everyone knows how to play and is fun for everyone. The rules are very simple, but a game of Connect Four can be very complex. You could try to trick your opponent and get a connect four or create a lose-lose scenario. RULES: 1. Two players put down a checker every turn. 2. The first player to get four in a row wins. (The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) 3. Our model will follow gravity like in real life. We find the specific rules here. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four"> Connect 4 Rules. </a> This model is based off of the game Connect Four. Your goal is to connect four of the same colored checkers. This can be done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each player alternates turns and every turn someone drops a checker. If the board is filled up and there is no connect four, it results in a draw. </p>

<h2>
	<p> We made a board as the first part of the code, so we could base all the movements of the checkers off of it. Here is the <a href= "https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html"> website </a> where we get the original image. We made code to move the checkers along the top of the boards. When the players reach their designated plot, they can drop their checkers down. Then, when there are 4 checkers of the same color in a row, the game will stop. </p>

<h2>
	<p> First, create the board. Play without one if you want to. Each player clicks on their checker button each turn and adjusts the checker using arrow buttons and drops it. You can also use the WASD and IJKL keys to move and spawn the checkers. Undo your last move by typing it in the command center. Start with “undo 0” and increase by 1 every time you use it. Go back to “undo 0” every new game/ game reset! If you want to undo the first checker, just restart the game. This model of connect four has the option to undo your last move if you mess up and want a second chance. Whenever one player achieves a connect four, it displays who wins, the winner’s checkers flashes, and a timer counting down the game restart. Lastly, we used these websites to code our Netlogo Program. <a href= "https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#output-cmds"> Credit 1 </a>

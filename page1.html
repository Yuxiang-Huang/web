<h2> HOW IT WORKS? </h2>
	<p> We made a board as the first part of the code, so we could base all the movements of the checkers off of it. Here is the <a href= "https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html"> website </a> where we get the original image, which is also showed below. We made code to move the checkers along the top of the boards. When the players reach their designated plot, they can drop their checkers down. Then, when there are 4 checkers of the same color in a row, the game will stop. </p>

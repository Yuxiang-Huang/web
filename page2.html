	<h2> HOW TO USE IT? </h2>
<div class="section"> 
		<p> Let’s start with the buttons in the interface. You can see a picture of it on the right. First, you can use the Create Board button to set up. Then, you will click on your checker button when it’s your turn and adjust the checker using the arrow button. Lastly, drop it when you get it to the column you want. Additionally, you can also use the WASD and IJKL keys to move and drop the checkers. Whenever one player achieves a connect four, the white output board displays who wins, the winner’s checkers flashes, and a timer counting down the game restart. You use the rematch to restart the game. Lastly, we used these websites to code our Netlogo Program.

<h2> HOW IT WORKS? </h2>
	<p> To begin the game we click the Create Board button and it will import the pcolor of an image of a Connect 4 board and add 60 so it will be blue. Here is the <a href= "https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html"> website </a> where we get the original image, which is also shown below. We had a dimension of 210 to 245, a 3 to 3.5 ratio multiplied by 70 to fit the screen with a patch size of 1. Next, whenever it is your turn, press the checker buttons, and it will create a turtle with a specific height and we use this y-coordinate so only this turtle moves. When the players reach their designated plot, they can drop their checkers down. We stimulate that by using the turtle-here command. It will first land in this hole then if there is a turtle already there it will go back to the hole on top of it. It will repeat 6 times. You might ask why 6 times when there are only 5 holes excluding the lowest one. It is used to prevent you from replacing the checker on the highest hole by dropping it in that column again. Lastly, when there are 4 checkers of the same color in a row, the game will stop. We did that using the command patch-ahead.

<h2> WHAT IS IT? </h2>
	<p> This is the Netlogo replica of the board game "Connect Four". We wanted something that was relatively simple yet fun. Connect four is a board game that everyone knows how to play and is fun for everyone. The rules are very simple, but a game of Connect Four can be very complex. You could try to trick your opponent and get a connect four or create a lose-lose scenario. RULES: 1. Two players put down a checker every turn. 2. The first player to get four in a row wins. (The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) 3. Our model will follow gravity like in real life. We find the specific rules here. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four"> Connect 4 Rules. </a> This model is based off of the game Connect Four. Your goal is to connect four of the same colored checkers. This can be done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each player alternates turns and every turn someone drops a checker. If the board is filled up and there is no connect four, it results in a draw. You can click on the links below in this website to see the corresponding explanations (some of them would overlap) of this netlogo program. I recommend you have the program open next to this tab so you can refer to it as needed or follow along.

<h2> HOW IT WORKS? </h2>
	<p> To begin the game we click the Create Board button and it will import the pcolor of an image of a Connect 4 board and add 60 so it will be blue. Here is the <a href= "https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/connect4.html"> website </a> where we get the original image, which is also shown below. We had a dimension of 210 to 245, a 3 to 3.5 ratio multiplied by 70 to fit the screen with a patch size of 1. Next, whenever it is your turn, press the checker buttons, and it will create a turtle with a specific height and we use this y-coordinate so only this turtle moves. When the players reach their designated plot, they can drop their checkers down. We stimulate that by using the turtle-here command. It will first land in this hole then if there is a turtle already there it will go back to the hole on top of it. It will repeat 6 times. You might ask why 6 times when there are only 5 holes excluding the lowest one. It is used to prevent you from replacing the checker on the highest hole by dropping it in that column again. Lastly, when there are 4 checkers of the same color in a row, the game will stop. We did that using the command patch-ahead.

<h2> HOW TO USE IT? </h2>
	<p> Let’s start with the buttons in the interface. You can see a picture of it on the right. First, you can use the Create Board button to set up. Then, you will click on your checker button when it’s your turn and adjust the checker using the arrow button. Lastly, drop it when you get it to the column you want. Additionally, you can also use the WASD and IJKL keys to move and drop the checkers. Whenever one player achieves a connect four, the white output board displays who wins, the winner’s checkers flashes, and a timer counting down the game restart. You use the rematch to restart the game. Lastly, we used these websites to code our Netlogo Program.

<h2> ADD-ONS </h2>
	<p> We made some commands to make this model different from normal Connect 4 games. First, it has the option to undo your last move if you mess up and want a second chance. Undo your last move by typing it in the command center. Start with “undo 0” and increase by 1 every time you use it. Go back to “undo 0” every new game/ game reset! If you want to undo the first checker, just restart the game. Also, we made the ending of the game special. When any player wins, you will see their checkers flashing and the congratulation and restarting count printing in the white output section. Warning: Don’t smash the keys out of furious that you lose the game because it is a thing of the output-print that will cause some random errors.

	<p> This is the Netlogo replica of the board game "Connect Four". We wanted something that was relatively simple yet fun. Connect four is a board game that everyone knows how to play and is fun for everyone. The rules are very simple, but a game of Connect Four can be very complex. You could try to trick your opponent and get a connect four or create a lose-lose scenario. RULES: 1. Two players put down a checker every turn. 2. The first player to get four in a row wins. (The row can be horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) 3. Our model will follow gravity like in real life. We find the specific rules here. <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four"> Connect 4 Rules. </a> This model is based off of the game Connect Four. Your goal is to connect four of the same colored checkers. This can be done vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. Each player alternates turns and every turn someone drops a checker. If the board is filled up and there is no connect four, it results in a draw. You can click on the links below in this website to see the corresponding explanations (some of them would overlap) of this netlogo program. I recommend you have the program open next to this tab so you can refer to it as needed or follow along.

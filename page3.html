<h2> HOW TO USE IT? </h2>
	<p> First, create the board. Play without one if you want to. Each player clicks on their checker button each turn and adjusts the checker using arrow buttons and drops it. You can also use the WASD and IJKL keys to move and spawn the checkers. Undo your last move by typing it in the command center. Start with “undo 0” and increase by 1 every time you use it. Go back to “undo 0” every new game/ game reset! If you want to undo the first checker, just restart the game. This model of connect four has the option to undo your last move if you mess up and want a second chance. Whenever one player achieves a connect four, it displays who wins, the winner’s checkers flashes, and a timer counting down the game restart. Lastly, we used these websites to code our Netlogo Program. <a href= "https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/dictionary.html#output-cmds"> Credit 1 </a>
